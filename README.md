Hello, I’m Iliana Leon.

I am an IT professional focused on the architecture and assurance of secure, mission-critical digital systems. My work centers on cybersecurity, AI governance, and human-centered system design, with strict emphasis on control, traceability, and operational accountability.

I design platforms intended for high-assurance environments where predictability, auditability, and human authority are mandatory. My engineering approach prioritizes governance, risk containment, and resilience over automation and unchecked autonomy.

My current work includes the Centinell Defense Suite, a secure systems initiative focused on governance-driven artificial intelligence, platform integrity, and controlled system behavior.  
Within this architecture, I develop Twin-based system models used for validation, simulation, and decision-support, operating exclusively under explicit human-in-the-loop control.

The projects presented here represent applied research and real implementations aligned with secure development practices. They are not experimental, autonomous, or self-directed systems.

This profile reflects a defense-oriented engineering philosophy: disciplined design, governed intelligence, and technology that remains subordinate to human command.
